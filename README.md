A 2d platformer game prototype

## Implementation
I added two of my own sprites
Made a death sound effect and music
added a powerup that allows the player to shoot fireballs
added another enemy that looks the same, but can either jump constantly, move forward constantly, or charges you when it sees you, basically mimics the other types
Also added an end screen
